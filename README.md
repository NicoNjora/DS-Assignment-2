# DS-Assignment-2

#### This is an implementation of the following problem:

A Toy Merchant application example communicates with a wholesale toy-service engine on the server that keeps a toy-price table to record the different kinds of toy's prices, takes the clients' tasks, queries the toy-price table, does the calculation and returns all results. You will need to write client and a server programs to facilitate interactions using RPC techniques for the following tasks for Client and Server respectively: 

- Your client should be able to:
1. Send the toy identification details (toy code, toy name) to the server program,  
2. Send the toy information (name, description, price, date of manufacture, batch number) to the server program,  
3. Send the toy manufacturer details ((company name, street address, zip-code, country) to the server program, 
4. Send a thank you message with a unique code (Innovate â˜º) to the server program 
5. Send all the above toy information in one single instruction to the server program 

- Your server should be able to:
1. Ask the client program to send the toy identification details (toy code, toy name) 
2. Ask  the  client  program  to  send  the  toy  information (name,  description,  price,  date  of manufacture, batch number)  
3. Ask the client program to send the toy manufacturer details (company name, street address, zip-code, country). 
4. Ask the client program to send a thank you message with a unique identification code. 
5. Ask the client program to send all the toy information in one single instruction. 
6. Server to send to client a message to indicate the communication succeeded or aborted.
